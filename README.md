# atmega32u4 Arduino "Rubber Ducky" Payloads

Some basic scripts for the Arduino Atmega32U4 "Rubber Ducky" USB HID.

You can grab a Atmega32U4 "USB Beetle" on Aliexpress and elsewhere for about Â£4, then get [the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) and upload these or other payloads to it and use it as a functional DIY "Rubber Ducky" style keystroke injection device.

I noticed that there aren't a lot of payloads for linux for the Rubber Ducky in general and specifically a lack of payloads converted for the Arduino, this repo is my attempt to rectify that.
